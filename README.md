# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial first step in the data science workflow. It involves analyzing datasets to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and visualizations.
This project demonstrates how to perform EDA systematically to better understand the structure, relationships, and important characteristics of the dataâ€”providing valuable insights before building any predictive models.
